# Samples for MQ for z/OS

This repository provides a number of samples that use the `zos_operator` module from the `ibm_zos_core` collection to run MQSC
commands against an MQ for z/OS queue manager. 

- [Interacting with local queues](mqsc/qlocal)

- [Backing up an application structure](mqsc/cfstruct)

---

These MQ samples are just some of the samples available for the Red Hat Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z. You can find samples covering other aspects at the [root of the repository](https://github.com/IBM/z_ansible_collections_samples).
